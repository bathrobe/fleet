# Refactoring Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

After the codebase refactoring, several issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Server Actions Import Paths

Server actions were still importing types and utilities from the old location (`@/lib/atoms`):

- Fixed import in `src/app/(frontend)/actions/atoms.ts`:

  ```diff
  - import { cosineSimilarity, findMostDissimilarVectors } from '@/lib/atoms'
  + import { cosineSimilarity, findMostDissimilarVectors } from '@/app/(frontend)/lib/atoms'
  ```

- Fixed import in `src/app/(frontend)/actions/synthesize.ts`:
  ```diff
  - import { Atom } from '@/lib/atoms'
  + import { Atom } from '@/app/(frontend)/lib/atoms'
  ```

### 2. UI Components Import Paths

Several UI components were still importing the `cn` utility from old or incorrect locations:

- Fixed imports in shadcn UI components:

  ```diff
  - import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
  + import { cn } from "@/app/(frontend)/lib/utils"
  ```

- Fixed import in `AtomDisplay/AtomCard.tsx`:
  ```diff
  - import { cn } from '../utils/cn'
  + import { cn } from '@/app/(frontend)/lib/utils'
  ```

### 3. ShadCN Component Aliases

The `components.json` file still had references to the old locations, causing styling issues:

- Updated component aliases to match the new structure:
  ```diff
  "aliases": {
  -  "components": "@/components",
  -  "utils": "@/lib/utils",
  -  "ui": "@/components/ui",
  -  "lib": "@/lib",
  -  "hooks": "@/hooks"
  +  "components": "@/app/(frontend)/components",
  +  "utils": "@/app/(frontend)/lib/utils",
  +  "ui": "@/app/(frontend)/components/ui",
  +  "lib": "@/app/(frontend)/lib",
  +  "hooks": "@/app/(frontend)/hooks"
  }
  ```

### 4. Missing Next.js Error Handling Pages

The development server was showing errors related to missing error handling pages:

- Added the following error handling pages:
  - `src/app/not-found.tsx` - Custom 404 page for handling not found routes
  - `src/app/error.tsx` - Component-level error boundary
  - `src/app/global-error.tsx` - Application-level error handler

## Verification

After making these fixes:

1. TypeScript compiler (`tsc --noEmit`) runs with no errors
2. Development server (`npm run dev`) starts successfully
3. All components use consistent import paths from the new locations
4. CSS styling is properly applied to components
5. Error handling is in place for graceful failure modes

## Best Practices Going Forward

To avoid similar issues in the future:

1. When importing shared utilities, always use `@/app/(frontend)/lib/...` for frontend-specific code
2. For truly shared code used by both frontend and backend, use `@/lib/...`
3. Consider using the index file exports where possible:

   ```typescript
   import { cn, Atom, IdeationMethod } from '@/app/(frontend)/lib'
   ```

4. Remember to update configuration files like `components.json` when refactoring imports
5. Ensure your Next.js application has proper error handling pages
6. Regularly run TypeScript checks to catch import path issues early
