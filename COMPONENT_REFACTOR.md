# Component Structure Refactoring

## Overview

This project's component structure has been refactored to follow a clearer frontend/backend separation pattern. Previously, there were components spread across multiple directories:

- `/src/components/` (root level)
- `/src/app/(frontend)/components/`
- `/src/app/(payload)/components/`

This inconsistent organization made it difficult to understand where components belonged and led to confusing import patterns.

## Changes Made

1. All frontend components have been moved to `/src/app/(frontend)/components/`
2. The old `/src/components/` directory has been completely removed
3. Import paths have been updated throughout the codebase
4. Payload (admin/backend) components remain in `/src/app/(payload)/components/`

## Component Organization

The current structure follows this pattern:

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── (frontend)/
│   │   ├── components/       # All frontend UI components
│   │   │   ├── ui/           # Reusable UI primitives
│   │   │   ├── ideation/     # Feature-specific components
│   │   │   ├── AtomSidebar/  # Feature-specific components
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── actions/          # Server actions
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── (payload)/
│   │   ├── components/       # Admin components
│   │   └── ...
```

## Benefits

- Clear separation between frontend and backend components
- Easier to understand component organization
- More consistent import paths
- Better alignment with Next.js App Router conventions
- Enhanced maintainability
